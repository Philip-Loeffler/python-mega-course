# this is implicit decarlartions of variables, python doesnt require you to define the type
x = 10
y = "10"
z = 10.1

sum1 = x + x 
sum2 = y + y

print(sum1, sum2)

# type function to find type
# z if a float, i know you're going to forget that so here is a friendly reminder
print(type(x), type(y), type(z))
