# tuples is just like a list, but they are immutable
# lists are mutable
# lists can have items added to them, making them dynamic
# tuples have the advantage of being faster, but you need to think if you need to have these things changed during the program


# tuple
monday_temperatures = (1, 4, 5)

# list
monday_temperatures2 = [1, 4, 5]
#  adding an item to the end of the array
monday_temperatures2.append(6)
